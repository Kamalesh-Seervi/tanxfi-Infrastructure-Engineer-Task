### Test Cases:

## Test CSV Parser

### Purpose

The purpose of this test case is to ensure that the CSV parser can correctly read and parse the orders from the provided CSV file.

### Steps

1. **Mock CSV Data:** Create a mock CSV file with a known number of orders and specific details for the first order.

2. **Run Test:** Execute the `TestCSVParser` test case, which uses the mock CSV file to check if the parser correctly reads and parses the orders.

3. **Assertions**
   - Ensure that the number of orders parsed matches the expected count.
   - Check if the details of the first order match the expected values.

### Expected Result

If the CSV parser is working correctly, the test should pass, indicating that the parser can accurately read and parse the orders from the CSV file.

## Test Revenue Calculation

### Purpose

This test case checks if the revenue calculation functions correctly by using mock orders with known values.

### Steps

1. **Mock Orders:** Create a set of mock orders with known values for order details (e.g., product, quantity, price).

2. **Run Test:** Execute the `TestRevenueCalculation` test case, which uses the mock orders to calculate monthly, product, and customer revenue.

3. **Assertions**
   - Verify that the monthly revenue matches the expected total.
   - Check if the product revenue matches the expected total.
   - Ensure that the customer revenue for a specific customer ID matches the expected total.

### Expected Result

If the revenue calculation functions are correct, the test should pass, indicating that the application accurately calculates revenue based on the provided mock orders.
